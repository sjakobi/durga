Durga is a Python library to consume REST resources with optional schema
validation.

It is named after the powerful and wise Hindu goddess Durga.

    "Durga the mahashakti, the form and formless, is the root cause of
    creation, preservation and annihilation. According to legend, Durga was
    created for the slaying of the buffalo demon Mahisasura by Brahma, Vishnu,
    Shiva, and the lesser gods, who were otherwise powerless to overcome him."

    -- `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga>`_
